In this Assignment, you will implement two classification machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes for the dataset (Liver disease dataset),

You will have 9 marks to implement both. Also, Compare the performance of each Algorithm

Dataset: liver_disease_1.csvPreview the document

The marks distribution is as follows

Import the libraries and Load the dataset and Remove/replace missing values (if any) [1 M]

Split features and labels [0.5 M]

Split train and test data [0.5 M}

Implement the Naïve Bayes classifier using Python

Implement Naïve Bayes Classifier [2 M]

Calculate accuracy measures [1 M]

Implement classification using Logistic Regression using Python

Implement Logistic regression Classifier [2 M]

Calculate accuracy measures [1 M]

Compare the results and accuracies for both the algorithms and share your inferences. [1M]
